"""The manipulation verbs of a single arm -- as a mixin, not a wrapper.

Ontology (see also the discussion that produced this):
  * **arm == manipulator** -- the SAME object, two aspects: "arm" = reach
    (a kinematic chain + ik), "manipulator" = capability (approach / pick_and_place /
    regrasp). A single-arm robot IS its own arm; a multi-arm robot's
    ``left_arm`` / ``right_arm`` each IS an arm.
  * **end_effector** -- a SEPARATE, swappable device the arm carries (mounted at
    its tip): a gripper / hand / tool. The arm reaches; the end_effector grasps.

So manipulation = arm (reach) + end_effector (grasp) + behavior. This module
provides the behavior as ``SingleArmManipulation`` (a mixin) that delegates to
the free-function cores (``gen_approach`` / ``gen_depart`` / ``gen_pick_and_place`` /
``reason_common_gids`` / -- later -- ``regrasp``). The scene is a collision world
built once via ``collider = arm.build_collider(fixtures=..., objects=...)`` and
PASSED explicitly to each planning call (``collider=``) -- it is a value, not
hidden state, so a call site shows which world it plans in and you cannot forget
it. Each method reuses the passed collider (context cached by its identity), so
there is no per-call rebuild; only a grasp / release ``refresh``es it.

Two hosts mix it:
  * a SINGLE-ARM robot mixes it directly -- ``class RS007L(MechBase,
    SingleArmManipulation)`` -- so ``robot.pick_and_place(...)`` reads naturally and
    no external view wraps the robot. ``body`` is the robot itself.
  * a MULTI-ARM robot OWNS per-arm members built from :class:`Arm`, e.g.
    ``self.left_arm = Arm(self, 'left_arm_waist')`` -- so
    ``humanoid.left_arm.pick_and_place(...)``. ``body`` is the parent robot.

The host provides ``arm_chain`` (the planning chain); ``end_effector`` is DERIVED
from the mech mounted at the chain tip (named once -- when mounted -- and swap by
re-mounting), set explicitly only to disambiguate several EEs at the flange.
``body`` is the kinematic robot the arm plans over.
