"""Pick-and-place motion planning -- move an object from a pick pose to a place
pose, composed from the existing building blocks:

    GraspReasoner.reason_common_gids  -- a grasp reachable + collision-free at
                                         BOTH the pick and the place pose.
    gen_approach / gen_depart          -- RRT to a pre-grasp then a straight
                                         cartesian line into the grasp, mirrored.
    MotionData                         -- the composed trajectory (robot configs,
                                         the EE joint config, AND the carried
                                         object's world pose at every waypoint).

Usually invoked through ``robot.pick_and_place(...)`` (the arm IS the manipulator;
the gripper is its ``end_effector``); this free function is the testable core.

ONE collider is reused across both phases (built once, ``refresh``ed at the
grasp / release):

  FREE phase (reach to pick): the collider is robot (+ its mounted gripper) +
    static fixtures; the manipulated object is NOT present yet (the grasp set
    guarantees its clearance, and the descent intentionally contacts it).
    ``auto_acm`` detects the arm's structural self-collisions once and caches them.

  CARRY phase (lift / transfer / place): the object is mounted on the gripper
    (``ee.hold``) and the collider is ``refresh``ed -- it rides the gripper link
    and IS collision-checked, so the transfer routes the HELD object (not just the
    gripper) around obstacles. ``refresh`` reuses the cached ACM (no re-detection)
    and AUTO-exempts the held object from the gripper links (the intended grasp
    contact). At release the object is ``release``d and the collider ``refresh``ed
    back to the free state.

The cartesian descent into the grasp and the cartesian lift/place legs are
ungated (the object intentionally contacts the pick/place target there, like
l1picking); obstacle avoidance happens on the gated RRT travel between them.
(Obstacle ``margin`` is a property of the ``collider``'s ``compile``.)

    ``grasps``: object-LOCAL :class:`~wrs.grasp.grasp.Grasp` records (as from
    ``antipodal`` / ``load_grasps``). ``collider``: the caller's pre-compiled
    :class:`~wrs.collider.mj_collider.MJCollider` world (robot + its mounted
    gripper + fixtures; NOT ``obj`` -- it is mounted on the gripper for the carry
    legs). It is REUSED across both phases and ``refresh``ed at the grasp /
    release (no second collider), and back to the free state after EACH yielded
    plan so successive grasps reason correctly.

    ``tcp`` is NOT fixed by the caller: by default (None) the IK tcp is each
    grasp's OWN frozen grasp-center frame (``grasp.make_tcp(gripper)``) -- no
    re-derivation from the gripper's current mode / closure, so a dexterous
    hand's per-grasp tcp is honored unambiguously. Pass a name/TCP only to force
    one fixed tcp. The gripper is posed from each grasp's frozen ``qpos`` /
    ``pre_qpos`` for collision (no width->qs lambda needed).

    Grasps are tried in LIST order; to try the likeliest first, pre-sort
    ``grasps`` before calling (``antipodal`` already returns them best-score
    first), so the early-stop pays off sooner.

    Yields ``(gid, MotionData)`` for EACH common grasp that fully plans, in the
    visiting order -- planned LAZILY (each grasp is reasoned + RRT-planned
    only when the consumer pulls the next item), so ``gen_pick_and_place`` can stop
    after the first and a viewer can plan the next grasp on demand. Each
    MotionData has parallel ``robot_qpos_list`` (arm configs), ``ee_qpos_list``
    (the EE joint config per waypoint; open->closed marks the grasp, closed->open
    the release) and ``obj_pose_list`` (the object's world pose per waypoint: at
