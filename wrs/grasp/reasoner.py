"""Grasp feasibility reasoning -- the "common grasp" kernel.

Two thin functions, no class, no hidden state:

    find_feasible_gids   -- which grasps are reachable + collision-free at ONE
                            object pose (the per-pose filter).
    reason_common_gids   -- which grasps survive at ALL of several object poses
                            (the intersection -- "shared"/regrasp grasps).

These consolidate the pattern hand-rolled in pick-and-place / shared-grasp demos:
transform each object-local grasp onto the object's world pose, IK the (pre-)grasp
frame, set the gripper to the grasp's frozen qpos, and keep the collision-free
ones. Grasps are :class:`~wrs.grasp.grasp.Grasp` records from ``antipodal`` /
``load_grasps``; world placement reuses ``serialize.transform_grasps``' convention
(``obj_pose @ local``).

Deliberately scoped to ONE robot against ONE PlanningContext over a set of poses.
Task-specific structure -- dual-arm grasp PAIRS, cable constraints, frozen-other-arm
states (e.g. kurabo) -- stays in the task: it is expressed by how the caller
configures ``ctx`` (and which poses it passes), not baked in here.
