"""Save / load / world-transform a list of :class:`~wrs.grasp.grasp.Grasp`.

Grasps are authored and saved in the object's LOCAL frame; place them in the
world with :func:`transform_grasps` (the dual of :func:`load_grasps`) given the
object's world transform. The on-disk record is fully self-contained -- it
freezes the tcp loc_tf and the hand qpos -- so a reload needs no gripper-state
re-derivation (see the ``Grasp`` module docstring). The gripper / object names
are metadata only, for a load-time sanity check.
