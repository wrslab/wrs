class MJCollider:
    """The robot's collision world: the planned mechanism(s) (``actors``), the
    static ``fixtures``, and the movable ``objects`` they manipulate, compiled to
    a MuJoCo model for collision queries.

    Built ONCE and reused across many motion queries; only a STRUCTURAL change
    (an object grasped / released / excluded) triggers a ``refresh`` (rebuild),
    which reuses the cached self-collision matrix instead of re-detecting it.

    Two collision exemptions are derived AUTOMATICALLY on (re)build, so callers
    never hand-roll them:
      * a grasped object (a plain SceneObject mounted on an actor's end effector)
        is exempted from that end effector's links -- the intended grasp contact;
      * an ``exclude``d object (e.g. the grasp target during its own approach) is
        exempted from all actor links.
    Grasping itself stays on the end effector (``ee.hold`` / ``ee.release``);
    this class only reflects it -- there is no holding verb here. Call
    ``refresh`` after a ``hold`` / ``release`` / ``exclude`` / ``include`` to
    apply the change.
